SAP UI5 vizFrame Playground

Demo page at https://athavanraja.github.io/sapui5-vizframe-playground/webapp/index.html

This is to help developers to visualize the chart before coding into their application. Its loaded with sample data/properties which user can edited and see how it affect the charts.

TODO:
1. Populate vizpropertie object with default values based on the selected chart type
2. Link gateway/generic REST service to populate data.

Suggestions are welcome.
